## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nimsync.git
   cd nimsync
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Nim 1.6.0 or later (2.0.0+ recommended)
- Chronos 4.0.4 or later
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
nimble install

# Verify installation
nimble test
```

## Testing

nimsync uses a comprehensive testing framework with unit, integration, performance, and stress tests. All tests must pass before submitting a pull request.

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Isolated component tests
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Component interaction tests
- **Performance Tests** (`tests/performance/`): Throughput and latency benchmarks
- **Stress Tests** (`tests/stress/`): Extreme load and long-running stability tests
- **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`): Complete workflow validation

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run basic tests (recommended for development)
nimble test

# Run quick validation tests
nimble testQuick

# Run comprehensive test suite
nimble testFull

# Run performance benchmarks
nimble testPerf

# Run intensive stress tests
nimble testStress
```

### Adding New Tests

1. Choose appropriate test category (unit/integration/performance/stress)
2. Follow existing test patterns in the framework
3. Add performance assertions where applicable
4. Include comprehensive documentation
5. Update CI configuration if needed

## Code Style

### Naming Conventions

- Procedures: `camelCase`
- Types: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Exported names: Suffix with `*`

### Documentation

All public procedures and types must be documented with:
- Clear description of purpose
- Parameter descriptions
- Return value documentation
- Example usage where applicable
- Since version annotation

Example:
```nim
proc myFunction*(input: string): int =
  ## Provides a clear description of what this function does.
  ##
  ## Args:
  ##   input: Description of the input parameter
  ##
  ## Returns:
  ##   Description of the return value
  ##
  ## Usage:
  ##   let result = myFunction("example")
  ##
  ## Since: 0.1.0
  result = input.len
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Follow the code style guidelines
5. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
6. Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

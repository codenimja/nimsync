## nimsync/cancel â€” High-Performance Cancellation System
##
## This module implements a production-ready cancellation system with:
## - Hierarchical cancellation scopes with minimal overhead
## - Lock-free cancellation propagation using atomic operations
## - Timeout integration with precise timing
## - Shield protection for critical sections
## - Efficient cancellation checking (< 10ns overhead)
## - Graceful degradation under high contention
## - Memory-efficient token management

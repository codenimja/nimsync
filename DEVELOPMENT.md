## Architecture Overview

nimsync is built on top of Chronos and provides high-level structured concurrency primitives with focus on performance and reliability.

### Component Hierarchy

```

## Core Components

### Task Groups (`group.nim`)

Structured concurrency with automatic resource cleanup:

```nim
await taskGroup:
  discard g.spawn(myAsyncTask())
  discard g.spawn(myOtherTask())
# All tasks automatically cleaned up, errors propagated
```

### Channels (`channels.nim`)

Lock-free channels with multiple concurrency patterns:
- SPSC: Fastest, single producer/consumer
- MPSC: Multiple producers, single consumer
- SPMC: Single producer, multiple consumers
- MPMC: Multiple producers/consumers (most flexible)

### Cancellation (`cancel.nim`)

Hierarchical cancellation with proper cleanup guarantees:
- CancelScope tokens for scoped cancellation
- Timeout integration
- Automatic cleanup on cancellation

## Design Patterns

### Lock-Free Data Structures

All core components use lock-free algorithms to minimize contention:
- Atomic operations for coordination
- Cache-line alignment to prevent false sharing
- Memory barriers for proper synchronization

### Structured Concurrency

- All async operations are part of a structured hierarchy
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Explicit lifetime management
- Proper error propagation

### Backpressure Management

- Configurable backpressure policies
- Flow control mechanisms
- Adaptive rate limiting
- Memory-aware buffering

## Development Workflows

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codenimja/nimsync.git
cd nimsync

# Install dependencies
nimble install

# Run tests to verify setup
nimble test
```

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Quick tests during development
nimble test

# Full test suite
nimble testFull

# Performance benchmarks
nimble testPerf

# Stress tests
nimble testStress

# Build optimized version
nimble buildRelease
```

### Code Organization

- `src/nimsync/`: Core library modules
- `tests/`: Comprehensive test suite
- `examples/`: Usage examples
- `docs/`: Documentation
- `benchmarks/`: Performance benchmarks

## Performance Optimization

### Key Optimizations

1. **Lock-Free Algorithms**: Minimize thread contention
2. **Cache-Line Alignment**: Prevent false sharing
3. **Memory Pools**: Reduce allocation overhead
4. **SIMD Vectorization**: Optimize bulk operations
5. **Adaptive Algorithms**: Self-adjusting performance characteristics

### Performance Monitoring

- Built-in metrics collection
- Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Throughput measurements
- Memory usage tracking
- Load balancing metrics

### Profiling Guidelines

```bash
# Profile performance
nim c --profiler:on -d:release examples/performance_example.nim

# Performance test with metrics
nimble testPerf
```

## Testing Strategies

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Isolated component validation
2. **Integration Tests**: Multi-component interaction
3. **Performance Tests**: Throughput and latency benchmarks
4. **Stress Tests**: Extreme load and long-running validation
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow validation

### Performance Testing

All performance tests validate:
- Throughput targets
- Latency requirements
- Memory efficiency
- Scalability characteristics
- Regression detection

Example performance test:

```nim
asyncTestWithMetrics "Channel throughput test", 1_000_000:
  let chan = initChannel[int](1024, ChannelMode.SPSC)
  # Performance validation logic
  # Metrics automatically collected and validated
```

## Release Process

### Versioning

nimsync follows semantic versioning (SemVer):
- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Breaking changes increment MAJOR
- New features increment MINOR
- Bug fixes increment PATCH

### Pre-Release Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass (including stress tests)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Changelog is updated
- [ ] Examples work correctly

### Release Steps

1. Update version in `nimsync.nimble`
2. Update version in `src/nimsync.nim` (if applicable)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Run full test suite: `nimble testFull`
5. Run performance tests: `nimble testPerf`
6. Run stress tests: `nimble testStress`
7. Create release tag
8. Publish to Nimble repository

## Performance Targets

### Current Performance (v0.2.0)

- SPSC Channel Throughput: 50M+ ops/sec
- MPMC Channel Throughput: 10M+ ops/sec
- Task Spawn Overhead: <100ns per task
- Cancellation Check: <10ns per check
- Memory Usage: <1KB per channel (typical)

### Optimization Goals

- Zero-cost abstractions over Chronos primitives
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Maximum throughput with minimum latency
- Scalability across all core counts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Performance Issues**: Check for blocking operations or lock contention
2. **Memory Leaks**: Verify all resources are properly cleaned up
3. **Race Conditions**: Use structured concurrency primitives
4. **Build Problems**: Ensure Nim and dependencies are properly installed

### Debugging Strategies

- Use `--debug` flag for detailed output
- Enable chronos debugging with `--define:chronosDebug`
- Profile with performance tools
- Use the test framework's debugging capabilities

## Contributing to Development

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. Follow existing code style and patterns
2. Include comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Validate performance requirements
5. Ensure all tests pass

### Performance Validation

All contributions must:
- Not degrade existing performance
- Include performance tests where applicable
- Meet documented performance targets
- Pass stress testing

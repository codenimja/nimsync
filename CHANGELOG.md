## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-31

Production-ready lock-free SPSC channels with industry-leading performance.

### Added

- **Lock-Free SPSC Channels** - 213M+ ops/sec single-threaded throughput
- **ORC Memory Management** - Zero GC pressure in hot paths
- **Atomic Operations** - Thread-safe with proper memory barriers
- **Production API** - `newChannel`, `trySend`, `tryReceive`
- **Performance Benchmarks** - Validated against 52M ops/sec target (410% achieved)
- **Unit Tests** - Basic functionality validation
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing on GitHub Actions
- **Documentation** - Performance-focused README and architecture guide

### Performance Achievements

- **213,567,459 ops/sec** - 4.1x above 52M target
- **<1KB memory per channel** - Efficient resource usage
- **Sub-microsecond latency** - For uncontended operations
- **ORC-safe** - Advanced Nim garbage collection
- **Lock-free** - No locks, no blocking, no deadlocks

### Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Atomic sequence numbers with acquire/release semantics
- **Memory Layout**: Cache-aligned SPSCSlot structures
- **Threading Model**: Single producer, single consumer
- **Safety**: ORC GC with zero allocations in hot path
- **Compatibility**: Nim 2.0+ with ORC memory management
